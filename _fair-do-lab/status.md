The following image describes the services, how they communicate, and their status. Not that some services, like RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch and Kibana are well-established components in modern infrastructures. The arrows describe dependencies: a service will not work properly if it points to a service which is missing. This should also help for the configuration of the FAIR DO Lab.
