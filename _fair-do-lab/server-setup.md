Except with the following instructions, everything is the same as in the [developer instructions](docker-compose.html).

## Docker setup

As servers usually do not have a Desktop Environment running,
instead of Docker Desktop, the server requires the Docker Engine ([installation instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/)).
The `docker compose` command should be available, then.
If it is not, you can [install docker compose separately (documentation)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/),
as also described in the [compose repository](https://github.com/docker/compose).
