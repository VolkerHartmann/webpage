Today, we like to announce the release of version 0.9.3 of the Metadata Editor. This pre-release is supposed to be used 
as a preview of the final release 1.0.0 planned for end of Q2/2022. The release package is published as 
[NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kit-data-manager/metadata-editor) and its content can be used by your project 
via [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/@kit-data-manager/metadata-editor). To learn how to do this, please refer 
to the [examples](https://github.com/kit-data-manager/metadata-editor/tree/master/examples) provided in our GitHub repository.

If you face any issues, please file an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/kit-data-manager/metadata-editor/issues).
