---

Today, we like to announce the new release v1.3.0 of base-repo. Besides regular dependency updates for security reasons, we've added some new nice features which
will increase your productivity while using base-repo for managing your research data.

##  :star: New Features
- Added CSRF and CORS configuration support to application.properties
- Added support for indexing and searching (new endpoint /api/v1/search if search is enabled)  for DataResources via Elastic
- Added new endpoint at GET /api/v1/dataresources for content type 'application/tabulator+json' for direct support of listing in [Tabulator](https://tabulator.info/)

## :beetle: Bugfixes
- User role INACTIVE is now properly checked. If a user is marked inactive, all access attempts will be answered with HTTP 403 (FORBIDDEN)
- Attempts to write DataResources if repository is in readOnly mode now returns HTTP 403 (FORBIDDEN) instead of HTTP 503 (SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE)
- Attempts to write DataResources without permissions now returns HTTP 403 (FORBIDDEN) instead of HTTP 401 (UNAUTHORIZED)
- MediaType detection and providing mediaType by user now properly works for ContentInformation
