---

Today, we like to announce the new release v1.4.0 of base-repo. Besides regular dependency updates for security reasons, we've added some new nice features which
will increase your productivity while using base-repo for managing your research data.

## New Features
- Creating resources from Zenodo JSON metadata has been added and is triggered by providing Content-Type 'application/vnd.zenodo.org+json' at POST /api/v1/dataresources/.
- Creating resources from DataCite JSON metadata is now triggered by providing Content-Type 'application/vnd.datacite.org+json' at POST /api/v1/dataresources/.
- Added support for using PIDs (prefix/suffix) as resource id without escaping while accessing them, e.g., GET /api/v1/dataresources/<prefix>/<suffix> 
- ContentInformation metadata now returns own ETags different from the ETag of the parent resource.
- The allowed size of description content has been changed from 255 to 10240 characters (see 'Migration Remarks').

## Bugfixes
- Creating resources from DataCite JSON metadata has been fixed.
- MediaType detection and providing mediaType by user now finally works for ContentInformation.

## Dependency Upgrades
- Bump edu.kit.datamanager.repo-core from 1.1.0 to 1.1.2 
- Bump edu.kit.datamanager.service-base from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1 

## Migration Remarks

For existing databases, a manual update is required to adjust the column size of the 'description' column of the Description table. 
The query may depend on the used database system, for PostgreSQL this would be: 

```
alter table description alter column description type character varying(10240);
```
