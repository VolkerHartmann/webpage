# ro-crate-java v1.0.3 released

Today, we like to announce the release of version 1.0.3 of ro-crate-java.

## Highlights

- In addition to Java 17, this release adds support for projects using Java 11. Both, Java 11 and Java 17 are LTS (long term support) versions, which makes helpful promises to developers. Our goal is to always support the latest two LTS releases.

## Other changes

All other changes are about maintenance: all libraries have been updated to their newest versions. For technical details and maintenance information of this release, please take a look at the [release page](https://github.com/kit-data-manager/ro-crate-java/releases/tag/v1.0.3).
