We are happy to announce our first feature release! üéâ 

As we follow semantic versioning, you are now able to make assumptions on the APIs stability. In addition, we have some new features added.

## Highlights üöÄ 

- üîç Directly ingest records into a configured Elasticsearch instance and query it via the Typed PID Maker REST interface. Without any limits to the Query Language of Elasticsearch.
- üñ•Ô∏è The Typed PID Maker has now a command line interface. Given additional parameters you can either write all known PIDs or even all PIDs of the configured prefix to a CSV file. Or you can even bootstrap an instance with those PIDs. This means PID messages will be re-sent, indexed, and marked as known.
- ‚öôÔ∏è There are new options to customize the structure of the PID itself. Give your PID a branding, change its length or its casing.
