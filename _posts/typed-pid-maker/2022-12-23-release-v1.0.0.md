We are happy to announce our first major release! 🎉 

As we follow semantic versioning, you are now able to make assumptions on the APIs stability. In addition, we have some new features added:

🚀 Highlights:

- 🏋🏼‍♀️ **Simpler JSON format for the REST API:** If the content-type and accept header are set properly, the Typed PID Maker expects and returns a lightweight format, which is still able to express the same information. This may be the default in future major versions. <https://github.com/kit-data-manager/pit-service/pull/77>
- 🗄️ **Persistent sandboxed PIDs:** For extended testing purposes and other use-cases, there is now a new internal PID mode which stores PIDs and their records in the local database. Compared to the In-Memory mode, this means that PIDs will survive restarts of the Typed PID Maker and be kind of persistent (if the database is properly configured). But of course, they are only resolvable using this instance, which is the main difference to, for example, the Handle Protocol mode, where PIDs are stored externally in the Handle system. <https://github.com/kit-data-manager/pit-service/pull/61>
