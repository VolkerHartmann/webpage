We are happy to announce our new major release! ðŸŽ‰

## Highlight ðŸŒ» 

We drastically improved and simplified the API at the same time. Validation functionality is now integrated as parameters of the logical associated endpoints. At the same time, the error codes now communicate detailed error messages about failures. This especially enriches validation. All APIs now have consistent API error codes and messages. In order to do so, we fully rewrote the validation system and did extensive testing of the API. Use our swagger documentation / openapi definition to see what has changed. ðŸš€
