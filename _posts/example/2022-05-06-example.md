This is an example news item. You see in the Front Matter all required properties. Furthermore, the file has to be named 
in a special way, i.e., year-month-day-title.md, in order to allow Jekyll to extract some news-related information from the
filename. Furthermore, you see the `tags` property in the Front Matter, which allows to match a certain news entry to 
a specific sub-page (see _example/index.markdown). Furthermore, the `breadcrumbs` property is important to allow to navigate 
back to the parent page if a news item was clicked and the user wants to return.
