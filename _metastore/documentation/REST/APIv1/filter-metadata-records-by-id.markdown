If you want to obtain all versions of a specific resource you may add 'id' as
a filter parameter. This may look like this:

{% capture my_include %}{% include_relative snippets/list-all-versions-of-json-metadata-document/curl-request.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ my_include | markdownify }}

HTTP-wise the call looks as follows: 

{% capture my_include %}{% include_relative snippets/list-all-versions-of-json-metadata-document/http-request.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ my_include | markdownify }}

As a result, you receive a list of metadata records in descending order.
(current version first)

{% capture my_include %}{% include_relative snippets/list-all-versions-of-json-metadata-document/http-response.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ my_include | markdownify }}
