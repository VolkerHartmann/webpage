For accessing the metadata record the same URL as before has to be used.
The only difference is the content type. It has to be set to "application/vnd.datamanager.metadata-record+json".
Then the command line looks like this:
{% capture my_include %}{% include_relative snippets/get-json-metadata-record/curl-request.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ my_include | markdownify }}

HTTP-wise the call looks as follows: 

{% capture my_include %}{% include_relative snippets/get-json-metadata-record/http-request.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ my_include | markdownify }}

The linked metadata will be returned. The result is sent back to the user and will look that way:

{% capture my_include %}{% include_relative snippets/get-json-metadata-record/http-response.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ my_include | markdownify }}

You also get the metadata record seen before.
