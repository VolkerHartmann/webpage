# {{ page.title }}

For accessing the metadata the location URL provided before may be used.
The URL is compiled by the id of the metadata and its version.
{% capture my_include %}{% include_relative snippets/get-json-metadata-document/curl-request.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ my_include | markdownify }}

HTTP-wise the call looks as follows: 

{% capture my_include %}{% include_relative snippets/get-json-metadata-document/http-request.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ my_include | markdownify }}

The linked metadata will be returned. The result is sent back to the user and will look that way:

{% capture my_include %}{% include_relative snippets/get-json-metadata-document/http-response.md %}{% endcapture %}
{{ my_include | markdownify }}

What you see is, that the metadata is untouched.
