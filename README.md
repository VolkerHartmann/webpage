# The FAIR Data Commons Webpage Project

This repository contains the Webpage of the department [Data Exploitation Methods](https://www.scc.kit.edu/ueberuns/15691.php#Anker3), which is part of 
[Steinbuch Centre for Computing](https://www.scc.kit.edu/) at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](https://www.kit.edu/) and 
also in charge of coordinating [Working Package 2 - FAIR Data Commons](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/en/fair-data-commons/overview)
of the [Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration](https://helmholtz-metadaten.de/de). 

The webpage, accessible at [https://kit-data-manager.github.io/webpage/](https://kit-data-manager.github.io/webpage/), 
serves as the main entry point to the FAIR Data Commons - Service Portfolio giving an overview about each service, its current
state, application cases and documentation for different target groups, i.e., users, developers, and administrators. 
For more information about the contents, please visit (FAIR Data Commons - Service Portfolio)[https://kit-data-manager.github.io/webpage/] 
directly.
