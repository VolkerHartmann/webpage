# {{ page.title }}

The FAIR DO Testbed contains user interfaces to demonstrate the services. They are not meant for the end user.

## Kibana

Kibana can be used to explore the database, but is being considered a management interface. It is not a simple interface for everyday search requests that should be accessible to all users.

> TODO add quickstart

## Fairris

Fairris is a small user interface to register FAIR DOs. Its capability is limited and meant for demonstrations, in combination with the sandboxed PIDs, which the testbed offers by default.
