For a data repository creating a resource and uploading data is only the simplest workflow. In many cases, additional steps have to be performed in order to obtain all required information, to validate an upload or 
to monitor what happens. For this purpose, KIT Data Manager offers a feature called 'messaging' emitting small messages after certain operations have succeeded. The following chapters describe how these messages 
are look like, when they are emitted and how to deal with them in order to react on certain repository events.
